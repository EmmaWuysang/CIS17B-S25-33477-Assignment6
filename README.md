# CIS17B-S25-33477-Assignment6

I created this program using the **QT Creator Community.** It should run perfectly fine, the only way to run the program is through the app/QT Creator I am pretty sure. I tried following the guy's tutorial on the lessons, but I had issues with that. 

<h4>STEP BY STEP : GUIDE</h4>

**To run the GUI**,
1. **download** the folder
2. go into **QT Creator**
3. Open Project
4. **Press** the downloaded folder
5. Select **all** the files in the folder *(It'll look like "build, CIS17B_Lesson_6_Assignment.pro, CIS17B_Lesson_6_Assignment.pro.user, main.cpp, mainwindow.cpp, mainwindow.h, mainwindow.ui, storagemanager.cpp, storagemanager.h, storedItem.h")*
6. after **selecting** all of that
7. press to **open** up in QT Creator
8. press on the file to the left bar **(CIS17B_Lesson_6_Assignment)**
9. click on **Forms**
10. click on **mainwindow.ui**
11. press the **green run button on the bottom**!
*TADA!! :)*

I will also upload pictures of the program running in case of any problems arising. I implemented a few rainforest photos. I also went through commenting most operations/parts. Files will be in a folder. Download & run in QT Creator! Again not sure how this'll work if used in VS Code. Email me if there any issues! ewuysang2@student.rccd.edu
